meta_description: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles.
---
Working with computers is quite interesting. Most of the people who work in this industry are only aware of higher level abstraction. I think the first principles which put foundation for a great revolution are equally important, to anyone who has interest. I regret it when I assembe things together but don't understand how it works in the lower level. This actually sucks, big time.

So, I want to dig all way down to rabbit hole. I was constantly looking for resources. I didn't find as much as I find for particular framework. This again sucks or may be not. But I found one just to get started.

It's [The Elements of Computing Systems][1] - building a modern computer from first principles. This is not only book, but an open source project by two professors Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken called [Nand to Tetris][2]. The same syllabus is used at Harvard University CS100.

Some of the key parts covered in the project.

1. Hardware
2. Computer Architechture
3. Data Structure and Algorithms
4. Progamming Languages
5. Compilers
6. Software Engineering  

Looks great. I have committed myself to finish this course no matter what. I will post all the updates along the way just to keep track of my progress.
