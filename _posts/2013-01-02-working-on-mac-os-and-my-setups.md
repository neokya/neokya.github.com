Well, Linux was my default development environment previously. I am trying to use Mac just for change. This is my setup.

- First thing first. I installed [Homebrew][1]. (I am using Xcode Command-Line Tools, not full blown IDE. I still don't get rationale behind why one has to install whole damn IDE just for necessary compilers.) Homebrew makes cool Linux style package management possible. As simple as this one `brew install git`
- While there is built-in Terminal, this [iTerm2][2] is much better.
- I use Sublime Text 2 as default text editor. Texmate is open sourced now, as alternative if you want to try it out.
- The 'top' command gives so cryptic output that I feel like puking all over. Thankfully, there is awesome little app called [Glances - eye on your system][3]. Here is [screenshot][4] if you don't believe me.
- As for Python/Django development, I found really good [post out there][5]. Sometimes the way these people blog, makes me jealous.

Well, that's it. So far, I am loving the new machine. Linux users will say OSX is horribly slow. May be good UX and ease of use makes it still great.
