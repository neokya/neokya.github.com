meta_description: My Technical Web Log.

I keep a personal blog on Blogger [here](http://narkumar.blogspot.in/). I used to write quite often when I was in college. After I started working, I somehow couldn't write much. May be I was busy, or I didn't put much focus on writing often. I recently read my old posts and was really happy. So, I am planning to put more time on writing.

I also wanted to keep a seperate technical blog. I spent lots of time on figuring out how I should blog. That was a bit lame excuse of not just start putting contents. Blogger or Wordpress didn't impress me much for technical blog. Tumblr, I never liked, except the fact that many people put some great contents there.

I knew Github is the best place. But writing on Markdown seems more time consuming then it actually should. I mean, I am not a prolific content creator and which format I write hardly matters. I just want to keep my web log, whenever I am not lazy. But again, I love Github and I want to blog. So, here I am.

Well, I was looking for nice Jekyll blog layout. I found  [@bhardin's](http://github.com/bhardin) blog. It's really nice. I forked it and made some tweaks. I am using [Mou Editor](http://mouapp.com/) to write this post. It makes writing Markdown very easy if you are on Mac.
